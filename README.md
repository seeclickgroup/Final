About and Thank You

This project was undertaken as part of the CS109 / STAT121  Data Science course at Harvard University.  The four person team is comprised of students from three different graduate schools around the university interested in civic data and data science.

We would like to thank SeeClickFix for providing a great API and access to their data.  Additionally, we would like to thank the City of Atlanta for their interest and assistance.  Finally, thank you to the professors and teaching fellows of CS109 who taught us and supported us in carrying out this project.

The bulk of our analysis was conducted in Python using numerous libraries including matplotlib, pandas, numpy, urllib, json, scipy, datetime, and networkx.  Thank you to the developers who made those libraries possible.  Additional spatial analysis and data processing was conducted in ArcMap.
