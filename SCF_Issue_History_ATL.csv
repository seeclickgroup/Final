176,8,"I think this ""improvement"" is another example of a knee-jerk reaction to a problem which does more harm than good. Atlanta's roads are being ruined one intersection at a time by these poorly-planned solutions.  Drivers can no longer turn right on red at this intersection in even moderate traffic, since there is no right turn lane any more.  Instead, there is a new curb which serves only to block traffic.

If the goal is to snarl traffic, why not make one lane of North Highland Ave a full-time bike lane, like was done recently to westbound 10th Street?  How about planting a giant Oak tree in the middle of the intersection of Piedmont and Monroe? Why not make the 4 left lanes of the Grady curve a drive-thru car wash?

179,2,"I agree that the new curb on N Morningside at N highland is a bad idea for everyone.  I often walk with my kids & drive through that intersection, and the curb does nothing to make the intersection safer for pedestrians.  The pedestrian cross signal needs to be fixed on all sides and it needs to be timed better with the lights.  Perhaps all drivers get a red light when a crossing signal is pressed.  Oh and the bulbs in all of the signals need to be replaced regularly so that people know when to stop and go... really Atlanta DOT... can't keep signals working properly because of bulbs being out?!  That's the most dangerous and most simple thing to keep up on.  

If DOT wants to make more routes safer for kids, one could look at the speeds at which drivers come through the NE (non-calmed) side of N. Morningside Drive.  Erroll Davis, in his infinite wisdom, took away the elementary school busses for this area causing double the driving traffic and double the pedestrians at morning rush hour and school pick up time (although MES has 2 more half-filled busses than last year... hmmm).  The traffic needs have changed since MES orginally was granted the funds to allow DOT to make safer routes to school.  The Morningside community generally feels that the traffic pattern changes have simply extended the dangerous routes and streets to what used to be quiet streets for kids to walk along.

After taking a closer look of the area, we have determined that the wall graffiti is too far into private property and the Midtown Green Team is not responsible for tackling issues on private property unless it is a matter of public safety.  However, we will pass this issue on to a City of Atlanta crew to see if they are able to resolve this issue.  We will keep you updated on any decisions made by the City.

I agree that Ponce needs more improvements further down the corridor--but the we are not allowed to spend MID funds outside of the MID district.  We hired transportation engineers to study the entire network of intersections in that area--14 in all--and devised a comprehensive plan to improve traffic flow in the area.  This project is the first part of that effort. We are also currently installing intelligent traffic signals that will be coordinated through a central monitoring location so they can be adjusted for special events (such as shows at the Fox), congestion, accidents, rush hour and so on.  The improvements to one intersection must be appreciated in the context of the whole.  I have hear that the Ponce streetscape to Moreland is moving forward so your concerns will be addressed.

I went to hop the joint and misjudged the distance, landing in the joint where it was about an inch deep. I fell catching my full wieght on my wrist. It was dislocated and had multiple breaks.

1197,5,"Yes, we had a site visit over a year ago I believe. Not much to report - the path had been built, the road realigned with less space and not enough room for bike lanes. My goals were to 1) help the city engineer understand why a sidepath would be less useful for city cycling than a bike lane to prevent this from happening in the future and b) to get ramps installed for access from side streets. 

Results were mixed. No ramps have been installed to my knowledge - I was told this was due to ADA, and the need to make the path safe for wheelchair users, which demonstrates why a bicycle lane was preferable in this location. The crossing at Piedmont remains very dangerous, as is the highway access ramp crossing - they did agree to install an additional sign warning of the ramp there. 

I would recommend contacting your city council member and copying the commissioner of public works on the email if you would like to weigh in. We gathered extensive feedback from cyclists but the reality is that once construction has started the advocates are too late. 

We started a neighborhood bicycle liaison program to try to stay better abreast of projects that affect conditions for cycling.

1260,1,"This car was parked in the bike lane on Monday. About a minute after taking the picture, the car pulled up next to me and started honking. The driver (whose wife apparently saw me taking the photo) began aggressively questioning me, taking pictures of me, and threatening legal action, as well as insinuating the possibility of other, supposedly more physical consequences. ""You have to bike past here every single day. Could be very dangerous.""

To me, he seemed very concerned about the possibility of his presence being associated with this particular location. Given his New Jersey plates, he probably wasn't too worried about receiving a cheap parking ticket from the APD that he won't ever have to pay. I won't speculate as to exactly what he was so concerned about, but I will note that every single car I've seen parked in this location has been different, and has had an out-of-state license plate. Which seems very strange to me.

The driver followed me to Inman Park station, at which point I entered the MARTA station to avoid further confrontation.",,Comment,2009-10-21T01:01:03-10:00,20910,9120,2173586,,Stephen Touset,,,2009-10-21T03:40:56-10:00,"{u'public_filename': u'/files/user_images/0000/0177/599px-Ruby_logo.png', u'name': u'MidtownCommuter', u'witty_title': u'Digital Superhero', u'place_id': 4129, u'civic_points': 1215, u'id': 291, u'reported_issue_count': 8, u'square_image': u'/files/user_images/0000/0177/599px-Ruby_logo_square.png', u'comments_count': 33, u'following_issue_count': 0, u'can_ack': False, u'voted_issue_count': 8, u'closed_issue_count': 5}",291.0,,

Thank you for contacting the City of Atlanta - Department of Public Works. A service request has been created for a traffic study to install a crosswalk and pedestrian light at Campbellton road and Cascade Glen. Typically, a traffic study can take up to 30 days before a decision is made by the Office of Transportation to approve or decline the installation of a crosswalk. At that time, you may contact Customer Service at publicworks@atlantaga.gov  or 404-330-6333 to receive a status update. Your confirmation number for this request is 805942.

This has to be a Georgia EPD issue if not a federal EPA issue.  In any case government attention to it should rise far above the City of Atlanta water department level.

Have you contacted the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition? They are active bike safety advocates in the city. You can see more at Altantabike.org.

This seems like an issue that could use a push from the community. If you have friends who would like to have this fixed as well, get them to jump onto SeeClickFix as well. It seems like it is a no-brainer and that the city would be responsive to a coalition of interested bikers!
