Because of the traffic lights on the west bound I-285 exit ramp turning right onto Ashford-Dunwoody, the traffic cannot move as freely as it once did before the ""Diverging Diamond"".  This slows the traffic on I-285 West back to Peachtree Industrial.  This causes Peachtree Industrial to back up which then causes westbound drivers to bailout onto Tilly Mill Road and Winters Chapel Road.  Drivers on Winters Chapel Road then use Peeler Road which then runs back into Tilly Mill Road.  That is why Peeler and Tilly Mill are now becoming backed up when they did not before the Ashford-Dunwoody ""Diverging Diamond"".  Also, Perimeter College traffic uses the same Tilly Mill and Winters Chapel Roads along with North Peachtree Road, which just adds to the traffic flow problems.  If you could fix the problems up stream at Peachtree-Dunwood and Ashford-Dunwood, the rest of the system would flow much quicker.It would also help on Tilly Mill Road if the traffic signals were more ""intelligent"" and could recognize changes in traffic flows on both Tilly Mill and Peeler Road and at Tilly Mill and North Peachtree Roads.Just remember that changes to any system, like adding the Ashford-Dunwood ""Diverging Diamond"", have consequences - sometimes unintended consequences!",830533,830533,33.91669788,-84.34218157,23263,1,3,2350,830533-backup-on-i-285-west-backs-up-peachtree-industrial-which-backs-up-tilly-mill-road,Acknowledged,Backup on I-285 West backs up Peachtree Industrial which backs up Tilly Mill Road,11/23/2013 - 04:07am,2013-11-23T04:07:54-05:00,210030,0,Traffic, , ,Traffic,0362,28,1161 Spartan St. Macon GA,http://bit.ly/18T1uhv,11/21/2013 - 10:53am,LARGE PILE OF LIMBS.

Initially, I thought there was a bad loop, but now I've noticed you've got video detection in place; however, it must not be working.   I've been analyzing the situation for several weeks and have discovered that it happens on the mainline as well as the secondary road.   For example, travelling north on Peachtree Road , get in the left turn lane to turn left onto Osborne Road, and you just sit forever or at least until another person comes up behind me.  Is the detector angled incorrectly, maybe so that it doesn't see my little tiny car and only reacts once another vehicle pulls in behind me?

The street was evidently repaved (maybe several times) and the grates were never raised. They are 2 or 3 inches below street level. No problem for a car, but on a motorcycle following a car, the dang things show up after the car you are following passes over them, too late for a following motorcycle to avoid. They wreck the @#$% out of a motorcycle. Can the city please raise the grates to be at same elevation as the rest of the street by putting some spacers under them, please? I think the depth of the drop hitting these is as much or more than any potholes I've seen on your show. I hope you can get them fixed, and thank you in advance for bringing them to the attention of the city, before they wreck some guy on a motorcycle (motorcycle wheels are usually in the center of the road, unlike car wheels, and hit the things.

Traffic that chooses to turn left (onto Buford Dr.) may be hit by traffic in the left turn only lane that has continued straight, disregarding the left turn only signs.

If an email to Mr. Kellum or Mr. Silver would be best to ensure quick action, please let me know.If there is an Ambassador in our area, I will be glad to meet with them to discuss the situation.Thanks...",657263,657263,33.802086,-84.255055,188889,1,18,0,657263-over-grown-vegetation-tree-branches-over-sidewalks-roads-uncollected-garbage,Open,"Over grown vegetation, tree branches over sidewalks & roads, uncollected garbage",08/30/2013 - 09:19pm,2013-08-30T21:19:13Z,7911,16,Overgrowth, ,Scottdale,Vegetation,02068,45,"2770 Lenox Road Northeast Atlanta, Georgia",http://bit.ly/16eURHF,07/29/2013 - 03:06pm,This is a heavy traffic area with sidewalks.

Before the change, it was turn left on green arrow, then switched to yield to oncoming traffic after.  This allowed cars to still proceed turning left when it was clear, and keep the flow of traffic moving.  Since the light change, there have been significant traffic build ups going as far back as Hightower Trail and even the Northridge exit.

Traffic sometimes backs up a mile up to the Glenridge Connector causing grid lock at the light at Glenridge Connector and Peactree-dunwoody.  There are two issues.  First, there is a huge number of cars making a left turn from Peachtree-Dunwoody South-bound on to Windsor parkway East-bound.  The short left turn arrow here causes a large backup of cars at an intersection with a very short left hand turn lane to stack the traffic.  Second, the traffic signal seems to give preference to Windsor parkway traffic which is never as heavy as the traffic on Peachtree-Dunwoody at this time of day. This traffic signal setup needs to be evaluated to allow better flow of the heavy South-bound evening rush hour traffic on this section of Peachtree-Dunwoody.

One of the worst things, is that there are no turn signals for the north and south lights at the intersection of Lavista and Henderson Mill. It's gotten so bad, I've watched people turning left (north) onto Lavista from Henderson Mill, actually turn from the straight lane, to get through the light, which causes the traffic coming out of the Northlake Tower Festival (where there is no turn light either) to be put into a dangerous situation. Obviously no one thought to evaluate or improve the traffic conditions when these restaurants were approved. People routinely slam on their brakes to try to get into the shopping center with the restaurants, or block lanes of traffic to get out, since the entryways near the restaurant are in a horrible place. With the increase in traffic, the road markings need to be improved also, the lines are faded, there's no reflective paint on the medians, so you can't see them at night, the turn lanes are only marked with faded arrows on the road, which people can't see now because of all the traffic, so they run the turn lane at shopping center entrances to get to the next one, and for the I-285 entrance on Lavista, there are no overhead signs clearly stating what lanes to be in, so people practically cause accidents to to get in or out of the entrance ramps. The traffic is also causing lots of damage to the roads, as they have started getting pot holes and other damage really quickly. This area needs to be improved quickly, since it seems the number of accidents is rising, or at least the number of cop cars are. At the very least, there need to be turn signals for all the sections at Lavista and Henderson Mill and clearly marked road signs above the road people can see, and better entrances/exits for the Briarcliff Village shopping center and Briarcliff Lavisita Shopping center.",419072,419072,33.84548399,-84.25576765,417058,1,3,0,419072-traffic-conditions-northlake,Open,Traffic Conditions-Northlake ,05/27/2013 - 08:33pm,2013-05-27T20:33:10-04:00,,2,Traffic, , ,Traffic,03197,1,"924 Glenbrook Rd Macon, GA",http://www.seeclickfix.com/issues/419067-yard-full-of-junk-debris-animals-chained-in-yard,02/20/2013 - 11:35pm,"This residence has junk and debris all over the yard, in the driveway and blocking entrace to the front door that appears to be a fire hazard.

He finally turned her chair around and was able to pull. A mother was pushing her young son in his wheelchair when he was almost tossed forward when she hit the large uneven bump. What was interesting, is that in both scenario's the people just smiled and moved on.  They have good hearts; however, I truely believe people with physical issues and their caretakers should not be burdened with such inconveniences. I am sure this city and hundreds of others have many obsticles like this for the physically impared, but it is something I observed first hand and I was affected by it.

At this point the side walk begins on the other side of the road.    Due to the lack of sidewalk, there are many adults and children alike are crossing the 700 feet pass by either walking on the road itself or by walking 2-3 inches away from the road. This is incredibly dangerous for the pedestrian as well as the drivers on Rucker St. I along with many drivers have had to swerve at 35mph after seeing a pedestrian precariously crossing this area only a few inches from the road. Pedestrians wanting to simply enjoy a morning or evening walk place themselves in mortal peril by crossing this pass. By creating a break in sidewalk, we have in essence segregated the two communities living on either side and significantly discouraged them from walking towards the other side.Simple Solution: Connect the existing side walk from before the bridge with the existing sidewalk 200 feet past Harris road. By connecting the two, you will ensure that drivers and pedestrians can coexist safely AND that pedestrians will not have to cross the road after the bridge and jaywalk unnecessarily.",219690,219690,34.07548679,-84.3275327,691942,1,7,0,219690-no-sidewalk-pedestrians-crossing-and-cars-swerving-dangerous,Acknowledged,No Sidewalk  Pedestrians Crossing and Cars Swerving  - Dangerous!,06/24/2013 - 12:40pm,2013-06-24T12:40:20-04:00,,3,Sidewalk, ,Alpharetta,Sidewalk,03828,4,"6080 Bethelview Rd Cumming, GA",http://www.seeclickfix.com/issues/219570-my-truck-takes-a-pounding-everyday-while-driving-this-road,08/13/2012 - 05:52pm,The road from highway 9 on up Bethelview Rd is in poor shape.

A car belonging to a new neighbor who lives on N. Druid Hills Road (3614 NDH Road) had been t-boned by a speeding driver.  It was completely totaled with all airbags deployed.  It was crumpled at the entrance of her driveway - she almost made it.  Thank God she was not injured.  Had she had a passenger or a child in the car, the same would not be said.I am a resident of N. Druid Valley off N. Druid Hills Road and we need your help with a traffic problem that has taken enough of a toll on us and our neighbors.  Less than 10 days ago, there was a fatal wreck near the exact same spot.  In 1976, a little boy was killed crossing the road to get to school.  The issue is that the speed of this road and the lack of traffic calming or electronic signals is taking its toll on us - the 110 homes in my neighborhood, along with the homes that line N. Druid Hills and the hundreds of homes in the area.To document crashes, injuries, and deaths, my volunteer neighborhood association, North Druid Valley Home Association has put together a website: http://www.northdruidkills.com This website is going to be used to continuously compile the dangers of this stretch of road that is handling too much traffic.  We plan on using it to raise the volume of our voice to get some help.  We hope you are listening.We are subject to the dangers of those speeding off 78 onto what should not be an extension of the highway - North Druid Hills is like a racetrack during the morning and evening commute.  It is a danger to exit our neighborhood at N. Valley Road and N. Druid Circle - we are completely cut off from an intersection with a stop light.  And we are in between a raceway used by folks who speed to and from work daily.  If we are not at risk of being hit coming out, then we are by turning in. Many of the photos on the website show rear-end collisions.Sincerely yours,Patrick S.Decatur, GA 30033Read the growing list of stories and the increasing number of photos here:http://www.northdruidkills.com",186758,186758,33.812055,-84.285679,813673,1,1,0,186758-north-druid-kills,Open,North Druid Kills,11/13/2013 - 01:35pm,2013-11-13T13:35:47-05:00,278677,0,, ,North Decatur,,04039,22,"1027 Towne Lake Hills East Woodstock, GA",http://bit.ly/JrGuaI,05/21/2012 - 12:00pm,"Street light out at 1027 Towne Lake Hills East, Woodstock GA 30189",186673,186673,34.1201327,-84.5499452,813824,1,1,0,186673-stree-light-out,Open,Stree Light Out,05/21/2012 - 12:00pm,2012-05-21T12:00:06-04:00,,0,, , ,,04040,0,"Brownsmill Rd And Jonesboro Rd Atlanta, GA",http://bit.ly/KkUjmR,05/19/2012 - 02:48pm,Litter is everywhere!

I understand letting North bound go 1st with the popularity of the Amsterdam Walk Shops but whynot let both lanes continue South at the end of the cycle like the North bound lanes do at the begining of the cycle?,181014,181014,33.7882222,-84.3672367,839026,1,2,0,181014-stop-light-programing,Open,stop light programing,11/01/2012 - 12:23pm,2012-11-01T12:23:05-04:00,,2,Water/sewage system,Morningside/Lenox Park,Atlanta,Drainage,04078,12,"217 E 65th St Savannah, GA",http://bit.ly/J10lry,05/03/2012 - 08:56pm,"street lamp out on corner of Battey and 65th, has been out for a week or two",180984,180984,32.0325741,-81.1031054,839208,1,1,0,180984-street-lamp-out,Open,street lamp out,05/03/2012 - 08:56pm,2012-05-03T20:56:43-04:00,,0,, ,Savannah,,04079,0,"466 1st St Macon, GA 31201, USA",http://bit.ly/IscWIJ,05/02/2012 - 09:07pm,This trash appears to be burnt can we fix it?,180592,180592,32.83655082,-83.63129079,840636,1,4,0,180592-burned-trash-can,Open,Burned trash can,09/18/2013 - 12:43am,2013-09-18T00:43:57-04:00,45490,4,Garbage, ,Macon,Garbage,04080,1,"3601 Piedmont Rd Ne 30305 buckhead, GA",http://bit.ly/IKc24U,05/02/2012 - 04:40pm,the drain and drain cover curb and side walk falling in right in front of marta bus stop just feet from bus stop its dangerous to people with handicaps and seniors! needs to be permantantly fixed. check it out see for yourself!,180504,180504,33.8523462,-84.3805409,840903,1,1,0,180504-drain-and-curb-falling-in,Open,drain and curb falling in ,05/02/2012 - 04:40pm,2012-05-02T16:40:48-04:00,,0,Water/sewage system,North Buckhead,Atlanta,Drainage,04081,2,"Bolero Way And Bolero Drive Atlanta, GA",http://bit.ly/JDq24t,05/02/2012 - 02:57pm,"Crumbling roads all through the Woods of Henderson subdivision, specifically at the end of Bolero Way at Bolero Drive",180465,180465,33.8680107,-84.2558361,841007,1,1,0,180465-pothole,Open,Pothole,05/02/2012 - 02:57pm,2012-05-02T14:57:42-04:00,,0,Pothole/paving, , ,Roadway,04082,4,"101 Drew Ct perry/houston, GA",http://bit.ly/JNHFMF,05/02/2012 - 12:03pm,Our subdivision Laurel Crist has probably not had the roads resurfaced since the subdivison was first made.

I have witness several near accidents because of the way people drive in the center,134882,134882,33.7763252,-84.1515723,1115946,1,3,0,134882-uneven-paving,Open,uneven paving,11/02/2011 - 09:45pm,2011-11-02T21:45:18-04:00,,1,Pothole/paving, , ,Roadway,04850,2,"U.S. 19 Atlanta, GA",http://bit.ly/rstt4g,10/23/2011 - 06:40pm,"I Like To Make A Request On A New Traffic Signal On Northside Dr. & DonaldLee Hollowell Pkwy In In NW Atlanta Please?",134646,134646,33.7730831,-84.40898895,1117264,1,3,0,134646-traffic-signal,Open,Traffic Signal,10/24/2011 - 02:28pm,2011-10-24T14:28:58-04:00,,0,Traffic,English Avenue,Atlanta,Traffic,04851,3,"U.S. 29 Atlanta, GA",http://bit.ly/rk7R2M,10/23/2011 - 06:26pm,I Like To Make A Request On A New Traffic Signal On Northside Dr. & North Ave In NW Atlanta Please?,134644,134644,33.77001515,-84.40459013,1117278,1,3,0,134644-traffic-signal,Open,Traffic Signal,10/24/2011 - 02:28pm,2011-10-24T14:28:39-04:00,,0,Traffic,English Avenue,Atlanta,Traffic,04852,4,"U.S. 19 Atlanta, GA",http://bit.ly/rfKNJa,10/23/2011 - 06:21pm,I Like To Make A Request On A New Traffic Signal On Northside Dr. & Cameron Jason Alexnder Blvd In NW Atlanta Please?,134642,134642,33.76816006,-84.40484762,1117283,1,3,0,134642-traffic-signal,Open,Traffic Signal,10/24/2011 - 02:28pm,2011-10-24T14:28:18-04:00,,0,Traffic,English Avenue,Atlanta,Traffic,04853,5,"735 Kirkwood Ave Se Atlanta, GA 30316, USA",http://bit.ly/poI1B8,10/23/2011 - 01:01pm,,134613,134613,33.7500708,-84.36317682,1117604,1,2,0,134613-damaged-meter-box-lid,Acknowledged,Damaged Meter Box Lid,07/03/2013 - 10:24pm,2013-07-03T22:24:43-04:00,,0,Utilities,Cabbagetown,Atlanta,Utilities,04854,6,"735 Kirkwood Ave Se Atlanta, GA 30316, USA",http://bit.ly/pLOaWV,10/23/2011 - 01:01pm,,134612,134612,33.7500708,-84.36317682,1117604,1,3,0,134612-damaged-meter-box-lid,Acknowledged,Damaged Meter Box Lid,07/03/2013 - 10:24pm,2013-07-03T22:24:43-04:00,,1,Utilities,Cabbagetown,Atlanta,Utilities,04855,7,"1644 Carroll Dr Nw Atlanta, GA 30318, USA",http://bit.ly/nzgJOw,10/23/2011 - 06:48am,"Carroll Drive is a residential road used as a cut-through by a large number of drivers.

However, there is a dire need for a traffic light and crosswalk at Campbellton Road at the entrance of the Cascade Glen Apartments before a driver or pedestrian gets killed. This location needs a crosswalk and light for several combined reasons.First, this is a large complex that houses a large group of citizens who rely on MARTA to get to and from. School buses also enter the complex to pick up students from several nearby schools. There is also a MARTA stop just outside the entrance on both sides of the street, but no crosswalk for pedestrians to get across to the East bound buses. Pedestrians find themselves caught in the motorist turn lanes trying to get across to the other side. More importantly, there is a blind curve that obstructs the vision of people driving out of the complex and the apartment marquis also blocks the vision of drivers trying to enter Campbellton Road. Once you have pulled out onto Campbellton Road, it's like playing Russian Roulette with the oncoming traffic you can't see until it's right up on you. Moreover, speeding cars coming around this blind spot and on the opposite side of the street have  led Atlanta police officers to frequently set up speed traps right here at the trouble area, instead of putting up a stop light to control the flow of traffic. What is needed is a crosswalk and traffic light on Campbellton Road and facing the traffic coming out of the complex to control the flow of traffic just West of Fairburn Rd. and allowing for the complex's traffic to enter the roadway with the threat of being struck with traffic coming around this blind spot. It's a ""no-brainer"" once you see the situation. And this would allow citizens to cross safely to the bus stop on the Eastbound side and allow drivers a safer way of getting onto Campbellton Road. If a crosswalk and light is installed, it should be noted that the Westbound MARTA bus stop should be moved back to the complex's entrance instead of the way it is now situated in between the complex's entrance opening and the exit opening.

Anytime it rains especially hard I end up with a moat. I have asked the city of Perry to maintain it because the ditch is dug out too deep and over the years when asked to fix the ditch they just kept digging it deeper. The drainage became so stagnant that in June 2009 an oak tree that had been on the property since at least 50 years fell over luckily hitting no one or nothing except the road. At the time, my mother spoke with city works supervisor and they advised her to engineer a plan to allow for a covered drainage system and present it at a council meeting. Problem - no engineering experience especially with drainage systems so since the tree fell it is now eroding my neighbors yard as well. The covered drainage system would allow easier maintenance of the ditch, safety of people and animals from falling in the deep ditch, speed water flow to the drainage system, remove the eye sore that has been here for years, stop my neighbors yards from having smalls lakes in their yards when it rains and no longer will I have to watch my yard turn into a flood zone because of the moats that are created by poor condition of the drainage in the ditches.",96636,96636,32.45411,-83.719291,1382901,1,5,0,96636-moat,Open,Moat,01/13/2013 - 07:26pm,2013-01-13T19:26:27-05:00,,4,, ,Perry,,05219,4,"Bellevue Avenue Dublin, GA",http://bit.ly/fYIP6m,04/21/2011 - 04:22pm,tree roots coming up under roadway making asphalt crack and causing rough riding,96558,96558,32.536705,-82.9191575,1383802,1,3,0,96558-report-road-issues,Open,Report road issues.,05/24/2011 - 02:34pm,2011-05-24T14:34:21-04:00,,2,Pothole/paving, ,Dublin,Roadway,05220,5,"Progressive Pkwy Byron, GA 31008, USA",http://bit.ly/hJHf1E,04/21/2011 - 03:42pm,Southbound edge of road lifting up and pot holes.,96550,96550,32.6167314,-83.74247074,1383843,1,1,0,96550-report-road-issues,Open,Report road issues.,04/21/2011 - 03:42pm,2011-04-21T15:42:31-04:00,,0,Pothole/paving, ,Warner Robins,Roadway,05221,6,"Woodland Byron, GA",http://bit.ly/dY4K7V,04/21/2011 - 02:10pm,The road has holes under the black top and bad patch jobs and a valley developing in the middle of the road that concerns me when driving you go bump bump down the road.,96525,96525,32.6616654,-83.7498282,1383935,1,1,0,96525-report-road-issues,Open,Report road issues.,07/01/2011 - 06:31am,2011-07-01T06:31:19-04:00,,0,Pothole/paving, ,Byron,Roadway,05222,7,"Turnerwoods Drive Gray, GA",http://bit.ly/gzVo5S,04/21/2011 - 12:58pm,"Holes in road, work done on water lines and not patched or fixed, severe dips in road",96482,96482,32.9970779,-83.5137113,1384007,1,2,0,96482-report-road-issues,Open,Report road issues.,04/21/2011 - 12:58pm,2011-04-21T12:58:33-04:00,,1,Pothole/paving, , ,Roadway,05223,8,"1100 Thornblade Dr Warner Robins, GA 31088, USA",http://bit.ly/dTFJdn,04/21/2011 - 12:29pm,"Each street in the Willows subdivision has cracks and sinking areas and large, deep water puddles when it rains, especially around the sewers.",96472,96472,32.55795456,-83.67766857,1384035,1,2,0,96472-report-road-issues,Open,Report road issues.,08/09/2013 - 10:25am,2013-08-09T10:25:58-04:00,,0,Pothole/paving, , ,Roadway,05224,9,"288-368 Margie Dr Warner Robins, GA 31093, USA",http://bit.ly/id7Kox,04/21/2011 - 12:26pm,This intersection needs a turn-about to keep the traffic moving smoothly.,96471,96471,32.61392994,-83.68989944,1384039,1,1,0,96471-report-road-issues,Open,Report road issues.,04/21/2011 - 12:26pm,2011-04-21T12:26:05-04:00,,0,Pothole/paving, ,Warner Robins,Roadway,05225,10,"287 Remington Ct byron, GA",http://bit.ly/erwHka,04/21/2011 - 11:55am,Marshall Mill Rd from Echoconnee Creek to Hwy 42 needs to be resurfaced. ,96458,96458,32.7086179,-83.8245018,1384070,1,1,0,96458-report-road-issues,Open,Report road issues.,06/03/2011 - 12:42pm,2011-06-03T12:42:39-04:00,,0,Pothole/paving, , ,Roadway,05226,11,"Frank Bone Road And Ivey Dr. Milledgeville, GA",http://bit.ly/h6JZWa,04/21/2011 - 10:24am,Potholes all along the road.
